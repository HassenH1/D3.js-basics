SVG paths

VV tells svg how to draw basically VV
<path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" />

M = move to //pick a place to start, not drawing yet
M150 is x coordinate 0 is y coordinate

L = line to //draw a line to a certain point
L75 draw line from M to x(75) y(200)
then we create another line
L225 draw line from position we currently were in (75 - 200) to x(225) y(200)

Z = close the path
